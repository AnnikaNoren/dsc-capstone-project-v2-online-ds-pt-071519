# Data Science Capstone Project



## Executive Summary

The goal of this project was to use the skills learned throughtout the Data Science coursework on a topic of my choosing and interest.  The project scope is thorough from start, source a unique dataset, to finish , display the results from modeling using maching learning on the web.
