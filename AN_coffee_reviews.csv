Makes a first-rate West-Coast espresso: smoothly pungent.,83,Peet's Coffee & Tea,Sumatra
5487,6,,,32/33,9,8,,,7,April 1997,Very Dark,"New Orleans, Louisiana",,Classicists who crave a very dark roast. The clarity and completeness of the Costa-Rican profile works itself out nicely in dark-roast terms.,81,Orleans Coffee Exchange,"San Juanillo Estate, French"
5488,5,,,30/32,7,6,,,6,April 1997,Very Dark,"Berkeley, California",,"The roastmaster detected peach in the aroma of this coffee. I got prune. Perhaps his peaches are my prunes, which doesn't say much for my outlook on life. Try it yourself.",80,Uncommon Grounds,Sumatra Gayo Mountain
5489,7,,,36/39,8,7,Java,,6,April 1997,Dark,"Berkeley, California",,People who find Sumatras too deep and too subtle. Try it strong in a French press; should handle both milk and sugar. Or how about a cappuccino drinker tired of the same old thing?,79,Peet's Coffee & Tea,Java
5490,7,,,38/40,6,8,,,5,April 1997,Dark,"Sacramento, California",,"Mavericks sure enough of their own tastes to makes mild ferment a virtue, like the mold on the deliberately rotted grapes that gives French Sauternes their special character. A mildly, perhaps pleasantly, fermented coffee like this one is a cultural conundrum. If some fancy folks in 19th-century France had thought it was a good thing to drink coffee from mildly fermented beans we might well find ourselves considering a coffee like this one a great delicacy. But they didn't and we don't. Ferment aside, the dark yet carbon-free roast of this coffee is impeccable.",77,Java City,Celebes Kalossi

5493,8,,,49/52,7,7,,,8,March 1997,Medium-Dark,"Branford, Connecticut",,"People who can't walk past a rose without sticking their noses in it. Drip-brew this coffee and enjoy it immediately, before the perfumes vanish. A Yirgacheffe like this one, with its complex floral tones, has to be one of the world's most striking coffees.",90,Willoughby's Coffee & Tea,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe

5495,8,,,44/54,7,7,,,8,March 1997,Medium-Dark,"Anchorage, Alaska",,Aficionados looking for variety in their East-African in-the-cup adventures. People who enjoy the Kenya profile but find the Kenya acidity too dramatic.,89,Café del Mundo,Smaldeel Estate
5496,7,,,46/50,7,5,,,7,March 1997,Medium-Dark,"Orlando, Florida",,"In comparison to the Willoughby's Yirgacheffe, this one has even more fragrance and less body, which makes it even more a flower-loving romantic's coffee. Or maybe a cross-over coffee for jasmine tea drinkers, although a Yirgacheffe like this one makes most scented teas seem as contrived as flavored wine coolers.",89,Barnie's Coffee & Tea,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe
5497,7,,,45/51,8,7,,,7,March 1997,Medium-Dark,"Orlando, Florida",,"You could see this one as a compromise coffee: It retains the Kenya profile but the acidity is crisper and brighter, more Latin-American than East African. Should be excellent drip-brewed and drunk black.",87,Barnie's Coffee & Tea,Kenya AA
5498,6,,,36/41,7,7,,,6,March 1997,Dark,"Kent, Washington",,"Seattle palates who want some Kenya with their dark roast. Brew it strong and take it with milk. Ideal for the sharp, carbon-toned cappuccino favored in San Francisco's North Beach; punches through the milk with no-nonsense authority.",84,Caravali Coffee,Kenya AA

5500,7,,6,37/39,6,6,Kenya,,6,March 1997,Dark,"New York, New York",,Anyone who likes both Kenya and dark roasts. Smooth enough to drink as espresso but acidy enough to remind you that you're still drinking Kenya.,81,Oren's Daily Roast,Kenya AA
5501,7,,,47/50,8,6,,,5,March 1997,Medium-Dark,"St. Paul, Minnesota",,"People who prefer grappa to cognac; people who eat the worm in the mescal. Like many Ethiopian dry-processed coffees, this one brews a perilous line between fruity and fermented.",79,Dunn Brothers,Ethiopia Sidamo
5502,5,,,36/39,6,6,,,5,March 1997,Dark,"Kent, Washington",,People who fondly remember the Normandy-style coffee they enjoyed one fall afternoon on the way from Paris to Mont-Saint-Michel. Which is a romantic way of saying that I suspect that this Ethiopian coffee is too delicate to maintain its character in a roast this dark and severe. But who am I to say: The last time I visited Chez Panisse they served a coffee that makes this one taste underroasted.,74,Caravali Coffee,Ethiopia Sidamo
5503,6,,,47/52,8,6,,,7,February 1997,Medium-Dark,"Portland, Oregon",,"People who like everything up front and immediate, even in their coffee. This is a coffee with some West-Coast, dark-roast character that, brewed strong, should please without distracting.",77,Bridgetown Coffee,Bridgetown Blend
5504,8,,,56/65,7,7,,,8,February 1997,Medium,"Waterbury, Vermont",,"Traditionalists who are acute enough to catch the grace notes. Don't waste this coffee on a buffet, the fruit notes will burn off before anyone tastes them. Brew it in a drip maker, but drink it mindfully, right after it dribbles. Go easy on the additives. If you're entertaining a small group that mixes coffee snobs with supermarket palates, this one might have a shot at pleasing everybody.",90,Green Mountain Coffee,Breakfast Blend
5505,6,,,47/52,7,8,"Indonesia, Central and South America",,8,February 1997,Medium-Dark,"Seattle, Washington",,"Classicists who brew with a French press; people who like a cup with power but low acidity; people who love coffee but still pour milk into it. Serve it to business meetings involving people from Boston and Seattle. Neither side may be completely happy, but they won't carp either. Should make an excellent espresso.",88,Seattle's Best Coffee,Seattle’s Best Blend
5506,4,,,45/49,7,5,Colombia,,8,February 1997,Medium-Dark,"Fort Bragg, California",,"Romantics. Should do well in both drip and French press. Brew it strong and it should stand up to milk but not require sweetener. Given Thanksgiving Coffee's commitment to small farmers and social and environmental issues, a good choice for post-Marxist capitalists who care.",85,Thanksgiving Coffee,Colombian Blend
5507,4,,,36/41,7,7,,,7,February 1997,Dark,"Berkeley, California",,"Peet's has always stood proudly at the darkest end of the roast spectrum: In Berkeley, dark is best. Brew this coffee very strong in a French press and take it with a splash of whole milk. Peet's slow-roast, smoke-heavy style manages to maintain amazing complexity under the carbon.",84,Peet's Coffee & Tea,Major Dickason’s Blend
5508,6,,,52/61,7,7,,,8,February 1997,Medium,"Hayward, Wisconsin",,"Another all-around winner for drip brewing. Should please just about everyone, but probably won't provoke much attention. This is a sophisticated-aunt coffee, the kind that should keep the generations from arguing after Thanksgiving dinner.",84,Backroads Coffee and Tea,House Blend
5509,7,,6,47/52,7,6,,,7,February 1997,Medium-Dark,"Ozone Park, New York",,Anyone curious about the name of the blend. People who waffle between drip and French-press and want a coffee delicate enough for the former but tough enough for the latter.

5510,7,,,63/72,8,7,,,7,February 1997,Medium-Light,"Flushing, Michigan",,People who remember how American coffee tasted before supermarket price wars and cheap robustas ruined it. People without pretensions but with good palates. People who are sophisticated but not afraid to smile at strangers. A good all around classic drip-style coffee; should be good both black and with something in it.,83,The Coffee Beanery,Beanery Blend
5511,5,,,37/41,7,6,,,8,February 1997,Dark,"Seattle, Washington",,"Everyone who's gotten hooked on the carbon-overlaying-bittersweetness of the Starbucks taste. Aside from Peet's, which is probably more so, the quintessential coffee for the West-Coast French-press experience: gritty, pungent, and stands up against almost anything you put in it. Unless things have changed recently, do not serve this coffee drip-brewed at a PTA buffet in New England.",81,Starbucks Coffee,House Blend
5512,5,,,54/61,6,6,,,5,February 1997,Medium,"Oakland, California",,The dry acidity and clear carbon notes are an unusual combination. Latte and cappuccino drinkers who are forced to drink drip might like it. Brewed strong it should hold up against milk and sugar.,75,Peerless Coffee,President’s Private Blend
5513,8,,,68/81,7,6,,,6,February 1997,Light,"Des Moines, Iowa",,"People who like supermarket coffee but can do without the flat, sour aftertaste. Best drip-brewed; the low acidity makes this one a good choice to drink black.",74,Gevalia,Traditional Roast
5514,4,,,/44,5,4,,,5,February 1997,Medium-Dark,"Clinton, Connecticut",,"People who don't know any better than to order coffee from a chocolate manufacturer who puts four-color ads in national magazines. Cheap shots aside, at a little lighter roast the herbal or fruit notes might make this an interesting coffee. As it is, it's probably too thin-bodied for the West Coast and too burned for the East.",68,Café Godiva,Special Roast
